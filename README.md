# no-css-html
To remember what I have learned from [Jen Simmons's course on LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/html-essential-training-4), I have built this small project. This contains **pure HTML** files, each note down everything from *elements* and *attributes*, to how to write *syntax* probably.
HTML code used in this project are:
* Paragraph
* Heading
* Bold & Italic
* Lists
* Links
* Media (Image, Audio and Video)
* Basic use of forms
* And some basic meta tags
